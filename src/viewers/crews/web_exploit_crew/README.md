# Web Exploit Crew ðŸ’¥

This crew specializes in identifying web application vulnerabilities and planning exploitation strategies for challenges in the CyberSkyline **Web Application Exploitation** category.

## Workflow

1.  **Receive Data**: The crew gets `crawl_data` (challenge description, target URL, VLM analysis of the web page including screenshots of forms, source code snippets) from the `CrewController`.
2.  **Identify Vulnerabilities**: The `Vulnerability_Identifier` agent analyzes the web page structure, forms, parameters, and VLM context to spot potential weaknesses like SQL Injection (SQLi), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Local File Inclusion (LFI), Remote File Inclusion (RFI), Command Injection, or Unrestricted File Uploads.
3.  **Plan Exploitation**: The `Exploit_Planner` agent devises a step-by-step plan to exploit the most promising identified vulnerability using common tools (`sqlmap`, `Burp Suite`, `curl`, custom scripts) or manual techniques. It suggests specific payloads or commands.
4.  **Validate Plan**: The `Web_QA_Validator` agent reviews the plan, ensuring the identified vulnerability is plausible based on the evidence and that the exploitation steps are logical and use correct syntax/payloads for the suspected vulnerability.
5.  **Iterate**: If the `Web_QA_Validator` finds flaws (e.g., suggesting an SQLi payload for an XSS vulnerability), it provides feedback. The crew refines the plan within the `ModuleAnalysisFlow`.
6.  **Output**: The final, validated web exploitation plan is saved as a markdown ticket.
