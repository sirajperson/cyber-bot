# Binary Exploit Crew

This crew specializes in analyzing binary files (executables, libraries) provided in CyberSkyline challenges related to **Enumeration & Exploitation**.

## Workflow

1.  **Receive Data**: The crew is initiated by the `CrewController` with `crawl_data` (including VLM markdown, screenshots) from a specific binary exploitation challenge module.
2.  **Analyze Binary**: The `Binary_Analyst` agent examines the available information (file type hints, descriptions) and suggests tools and steps for reverse engineering or dynamic analysis (e.g., using Ghidra, GDB, dnSpy, strings).
3.  **Validate Plan**: The `RE_Validator` agent reviews the `Binary_Analyst`'s plan for correctness and feasibility based on the provided context (e.g., ensuring the suggested tool matches the file type).
4.  **Iterate**: If the `RE_Validator` finds flaws, it provides specific feedback, and the `Binary_Analyst` refines the plan. This repeats within the `ModuleAnalysisFlow` until the plan is valid or retries are exhausted.
5.  **Output**: The final, validated plan is saved as a markdown ticket.
