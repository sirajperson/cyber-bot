# Log Analysis Crew ðŸ“Š

This crew specializes in analyzing various types of log files (e.g., web server logs, system logs, application logs) provided in CyberSkyline challenges.

## Workflow

1.  **Receive Data**: The crew is initiated with `crawl_data` containing the challenge description, VLM markdown of the log snippets or context, and possibly links to larger log files.
2.  **Plan Parsing**: The `Log_Parser` agent determines the log format (e.g., Apache Common Log Format, JSON, syslog) and suggests methods or tools (`grep`, `awk`, `sed`, regex, specific log analysis tools if applicable) to filter and extract relevant entries based on the challenge goal.
3.  **Identify Threats/Anomalies**: The `Threat_Identifier` agent analyzes the parsed log entries or the overall log context to find suspicious activities, patterns, or anomalies (e.g., brute-force attempts, SQL injection patterns, error spikes, IOCs).
4.  **Validate Findings**: The `SOC_Validator` agent reviews the identified threats and the parsing plan, checking for logical consistency and potential false positives based on common log noise.
5.  **Iterate**: If the `SOC_Validator` finds issues (e.g., misinterpreting benign bot traffic as malicious), it provides feedback. The crew refines the analysis within the `ModuleAnalysisFlow`.
6.  **Output**: The final, validated log analysis findings and plan are saved as a markdown ticket.
